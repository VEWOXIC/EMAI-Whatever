## Team

1. Coder: maintain the whole project, make sure every part compatable, finetune
2. Researcher: Read related papers, find avaliable models discuss with model architecture and realize it. 
3. Data Processor: clean/preprocess the data, maintain the data
4. Model Architecture: maintain the model.py design the model

## Milestone

- ~~ data visualization and cleansing ~~
- ~~ basic baseline and file architecture ~~
- better data cleansing and better way to use timestamp (3~4 days need to adapt to the model design)
- try out/ design advanced models (14 days across the whole period)
- final finetune (3~4 days)
